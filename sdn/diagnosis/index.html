    <h1>NFV Cross-Layer Diagnosis</h1>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Quality of Service (QoS) is so critical in the telecom domain. There is an underlying service expection
            that outrages will be below milliseconds. Service impacting outrages beed to be limited to a certain amount
            of users and network wide outrages are not acceptable for telecom providers. Furthermore, service
            continuity is not only customer expectations, but often a regulatory requirement, as telecommunication
            networks are considered to be part of critical national infrastructures. However, not every Network
            Function has the same requirements for resiliency. For example, telephony usually has the highest
            requirement for availability, while short messaging service may have lower requirement. Thus, multiple
            availability  classes will be designed which should be supported by a Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
            framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            The virtualization of Network Functions needs to fulfill top-level design criteria, including: Service
            Continuity, Automated Recovery, No Single Point of Failure, Multi-Vendor Environment and Hybrid
            Infrastructure.

    <h2>Fault Injection</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Fault Injection is an important part of the overall diagnosis. In order to comprehensively compare proposed
            method against existing methods, we have to test it on various faults, including hardware faults, software
            faults and configuration error. However, according to our survey, there are no such comprehensive work about
            fault injection in OpenStack. Most of current diagnosis works uses several so called typical errors. Thus,
            we're going to build a fault injection framework, which is able inject particular faults, test OpenStack
            functions and restore machine's original state. Our work can be divided into three parts: fault injection,
            Function testing and machine restoration.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Fast Error Locating</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Although OpenStack already has certain mechanisms to locate errors, it's still insufficient for some
            common errors. For example, when requesting a VM on Horozon, there is an error indicating that no
            available compute node for requested VM. However, the dashboard does indicate that there are compute nodes.
            Similar errors is common in production. To solve those misleading errors, administrators have to spend
            huge amount of time in checking logs. While checking logs seems OK for data centers, it definitely
            intolerable for telecom communication networks. Errors are required to fixed as quick as possible. So,
            it is vital to find a method which is able to fast locate original errors.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Failure Prediction</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Simply design a system locating original error is far less than enough to meet the the needs in industrial
            requirements. As mentioned above, reliability is one of the most import requirements for telecom products.
            It is required for us to detect potential or minor faults before it evolves to fatal errors. Thus, it is
            important to design a system which is able to monitor the whole system in realtime, giving out realtime
            health report.
        </p>
