To break the long-lasting barrier, SDN is designed to            separate intelligent control plane (controller) from switching fabrics, and make data plane simple and fast            at forwarding packets, ushering in enormous opportunities for rapid open innovations and quick creation of            customer services.        </p>        <p>            While SDN suggests a new network architecture for open service introduction, its openness            also has caused serious security and performance issues, which drive us to dedicate the research efforts            on various SDN topics, including SDN security, SDN policy updates, SDN data-plane verification, etc.        </p>    </blockquote>    <blockquote>        <p>            Network Operator's networks are populated with a large and increasing variety of proprietary hardware            appliances. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) aims to address increasing problems resulted from            proprietary hardware appliances by leveraging standard IT virtualization technology to consolidate many            network equipment types onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage, which could be            located in Datacenters, Network Nodes and in the end user premises. Network Functions Virtualization is            highly complementary to Software Defined Networking. Virtualizing Network Functions could potentially            offer many benefits, including , but not limited to, reducing equipment cost and power cost, increasing            speed of Time to Market, providing network appliance multi-tenancy.        </p>        <p>            However, there are unique challenges and opportunities to ensuring service availability, maintaining            resiliency in an NFV-based system. It is also critical to assure the security of NFV along with cloud            computing, since a large fraction of the global economy depends on it.        </p>    </blockquote>    <h2>Projects</h2>    <ul>        <li>            <span class="badge">NEW</span>            <h4><a href="diagnosis/index.html">NFV Diagnosis</a></h4>            <p>                The key differentiator of virtualized data centers between the IT and telecom domains is the level of                service continuity. Whereas in the IT domain outrages lasting seconds are tolerable and the service                user typically initiates retries, in the telecom domain there is an underlying service expectation that                outrages will be below the recognizable level, and service recovery is performed automatically. Thus,                it is vital to control outrages in negligible time, limit the amount of affected users.            </p>        </li>        <li>            <h4><a href="sdnshield/index.html">SDNShield</a></h4>            <p>                The SDN paradigm embraces third-party development                efforts, and therefore suffers from potential                attacks that usurp the excessive privileges                of control plane applications. Such privilege abuse                could lead to various attacks impacting the entire                administrative domain. In this project, we design                an access control system tailered for SDN application                environment.            </p>        </li>        <li>            <h4><a href="ruletris/index.html">RuleTris</a></h4>            <p>                Modular composition in software-defined networks ensures                the correctness of independently deployed applications.                Current modular composition techniques are                not optimal in terms of both the number of rule updates                to the data plane switches and the latency cost of                individual updates.                In this project, we design end-to-end optimization framework                for software-defined networks that significantly accelerate                network policy updates.            </p>        </li>        <li>            <h4><a href="rulescope/index.html">RuleScope</a></h4>            <p>                Due to hardware and software problems, the dataplane state                may not be congruent to the configuration specifications of                the control plane in software defined networks. There is a                pressing need for data plane mechanisms that can detect and                identify offending forwarding rules.                In this project, we study the fault models of forwarding                elements and design probing systems that discover and troubleshoot                these faults.            </p>        </li>    </ul>    <h2>Publications</h2>    <ul>        <li>            Kai Bu, Xitao Wen, Bo Yang, Yan Chen, Li Erran Li, Xiaolin Chen,            <a href="rulescope/papers/infocom16.pdf">                <i>"Is Every Flow on The Right Track?: Inspect SDN Forwarding with RuleScope"</i>            </a>, in the Proc. of <i>IEEE INFOCOM</i>, 2016.        </li>        <li>Xitao Wen, Chunxiao Diao, Xun Zhao, Yan Chen, Li Erran Li, Bo Yang, Kai Bu,            <a href="ruletris/papers/compact_update_hotsdn.pdf">                <i>"Compiling Minimum Incremental Update for Modular SDN Languages"</i>            </a>, in Proceedings of <i>HotSDN 2014</i>, Chicago, IL, August 2014.        </li>        <li>Xitao Wen, Yan Chen, Chengchen Hu, Chao Shi, Yi Wang,            <a href="sdnshield/papers/permof_hotsdn.pdf">                <i>"Towards A Secure Controller Platform for OpenFlow Application"</i>            </a>, short paper in <i>HotSDN 2013</i>, Hong Kong, China, August 2013.        </li>        <li>Xitao Wen, Yan Chen, Chengchen Hu, Chao Shi, Yi Wang,            <a href="sdnshield/papers/permof_nsdi_poster.pdf">                <i>"Towards A Secure Controller Platform for OpenFlow Application"</i>            </a>, poster paper in <i>NSDI 2013</i>, Lombard, IL, April 2013.        </li>        <li>            Xitao Wen, Kai Chen, Yan Chen, Yongqiang Liu, Yong Xia, Chengchen Hu,            <a href="rulescope/papers/virtualKnotter_ICDCS12.pdf">                <i>"VirtualKnotter: Online Virtual Machine Shuffling for Congestion Resolving in Virtualized                    Datacenter"</i>            </a>, in Proceedings of <i>IEEE ICDCS</i>, Macau, China, June 2012.        </li>    </ul>    <h2>Patent</h2>    <ul>        <li>            "The Method for Control-layer Application Access Control and Controller", Pending China Patent: CN            201510064799.5.        </li>    </ul>    <div class="row">        <div class="col-md-4">            <h2>People</h2>            <ul>                <li>Libin Song (Northwestern University)</li>                <li>Xue Leng (Zhejiang University)</li>                <li>Yinbo Yu (Wuhan University)</li>                <li>Bo Yang (Zhejiang University)</li>                <li>Kai Bu (Zhejiang University)</li>                <li><a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ychen/"> Yan Chen (Northwestern University)</a></li>            </ul>        </div>        <div class="col-md-4">            <h2>Collaborators</h2>            <ul>                <li>Jianfeng Yang (Wuhan University)</li>                <li>Xiaolin Chen (Chuxiong Normal University)</li>                <li><a href="http://erranlli.appspot.com/">Li Erran Li</a> (Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent)</li>                <li><a href="http://nskeylab.xjtu.edu.cn/people/cchu">Chengchen Hu</a> (Xi'an Jiaotong University)</li>                <li>Bin Liu (Tsinghua University)</li>            </ul>        </div>        <div class="col-md-4">            <h2>Alumni</h2>            <ul>                <li><a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~xwe334/">Xitao Wen (Northwestern University)</a></li>            </ul>        </div>    </div></div></body></html>
